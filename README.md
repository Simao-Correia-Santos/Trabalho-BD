# DB-Project
Academic project developed as part of the DataBase course in the Computer Engineering program (2022-2023)

## 🎯Goal/Description
This	project	aims	at	developing	a simplified	music	streaming	platform.	
The system must be made available through a REST API that allows the user to access it through HTTP requests. As it can be seen, the user interacts with the web server through a REST request/response exchange, and in turn, the web server interacts with the database server through an SQL interface. To use or test the REST API, you must use the REST client Postman.
